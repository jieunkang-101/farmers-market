#### React fundamentals exercise at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/), 04.21.2020 

#### By **Jieun Kang**

## Description 
Avery's Organics is a mid-sized farm in Northern Oregon that grows organic produce and sells it at farmers markets throughout town. Since Avery's is at a different market almost every day, they've started a website to show customers which market they will be at on a given day.<br>
Avery's also grows different crops in different seasons. They'd like to display what produce is available during which months on their site too.<br>
Using React and all other tools we've covered so far, create a website that depicts this information.
